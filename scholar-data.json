However, the identification of such systems often faces significant hurdles due to data scarcity, with existing approaches typically requiring substantial amounts of data for effective training. Addressing this challenge, this paper introduces a novel transfer learning framework designed specifically for MIMO system identification under conditions of limited data and inherent uncertainties. The proposed framework is applied to two case studies: the first in metal additive manufacturing, specifically the laser-blown powder-directed energy deposition as the source domain and the laser hot wire-directed energy deposition as the target domain, and the second involving a nonlinear case study of a \u2026",

      "abstract": "In the Industry 4.0 era, additive manufacturing (AM), particularly metal AM, has become a transformative technology due to its ability to efficiently produce complex geometries. Despite its potential, the industry still faces challenges in implementing robust real-time process monitoring algorithms. Recent advancements highlight that melt pool (MP) signatures during fabrication provide critical insights into process dynamics and quality. To capture this data, sensory systems such as high-speed camera-based vision modules are utilized for online monitoring. However, conventional analysis methods often struggle to process large volumes of data simultaneously. While traditional image processing (ImP) techniques offer a tunable approach, they present a trade-off between speed and accuracy, making them unsuitable for dynamic applications like MP monitoring. This work proposes the tunable deep transformer image processing (TDTIP) method, which integrates a hybrid convolutional auto-encoder (HCAE) architecture with a vision transformer (ViT) framework to meet the real-time demands of data-intensive monitoring. The model is trained in three phases: first, to replicate ImP algorithms with tunable features; second, to incorporate MP geometries; and third, to evaluate fabrication quality based on visual input and process parameters. TDTIP achieves over 94% estimation accuracy, with an R2 score exceeding 96% for the estimation and isolation of quality, geometry, and MP signatures. Additionally, the model processes data at an average rate of 500 frames per second (fps), a dramatic improvement over the time-consuming conventional methods \u2026",

Traditional methods, are slow to converge and require extensive manual effort to translate data into actionable insights, rendering them impractical for real-time monitoring and control. To address this challenge, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based solution aimed at reducing manual data processing reliance and improving the efficiency of transitioning from data to insight. In our study, we utilize a dataset comprising dual-wavelength real-time process monitoring data and corresponding temperature maps. We introduce a deep learning model called the \"Binocular model,\" which exploits dual input observations to perform a precise analysis of MP temperature in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). Through advanced deep learning techniques, we seamlessly convert raw data into temperature maps, significantly streamlining the process and enabling batch processing at a rate of up to 750 frames per second, approximately 1000 times faster than conventional methods. Our Binocular model achieves high accuracy in temperature estimation, evidenced by a 0.95 R-squared score, while simultaneously enhancing processing efficiency by a factor of  times. This model directly addresses the challenge of real-time MP temperature monitoring and offers insights into the encountered constraints and the benefits of our Deep Learning-based approach. By combining efficiency and precision, our work contributes to the advancement of temperature \u2026",

      "abstract": "This study applies a hybridized wavelet transform-artificial neural network (WT-ANN) model to simulate the acetone detecting ability of the Indium oxide/Iron oxide (In2O3/Fe2O3) nanocomposite sensors. The WT-ANN has been constructed to extract the sensor resistance ratio (SRR) in the air with respect to the acetone from the nanocomposite chemistry, operating temperature, and acetone concentration. The performed sensitivity analyses demonstrate that a single hidden layer WT-ANN with nine nodes is the highest accurate model for automating the acetone-detecting ability of the In2O3/Fe2O3 sensors. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm has fine-tuned the shape-related parameters of the B-spline wavelet transfer function. This model accurately predicts the SRR of the 119 nanocomposite sensors with a mean absolute error of 0.7, absolute average relative deviation of 10.12%, root mean squared error of 1.14 \u2026",

Despite its potential, this industry still lacks real-time capable process monitoring algorithms. Recent advancements in this field suggest that Melt Pool (MP) signatures during the fabrication process contain crucial information about process dynamics and quality. To obtain this information, various sensory approaches, such as high-speed cameras-based vision modules are employed for online fabrication monitoring. However, many conventional in-depth analyses still cannot process all the recorded data simultaneously. Although conventional Image Processing (ImP) solutions provide a targeted tunable approach, they pose a trade-off between convergence certainty and convergence speed. As a result \u2026",

Thorough knowledge of the AM processes is needed to develop such a controller. Recent studies utilized various methods to acquire data from the process, build insight into the process, and detect anomalies within the process. However, each sensory method has its unique limitations and capabilities. Sensor fusion techniques based on Machine Learning (ML) methods can combine all the data acquisition sources to form a holistic monitoring system for better data aggregation and enhanced detection. This holistic approach could also be used to train a controller on top of the fusion system to master the AM production and increase its reliance. This article summarizes recent studies on sensor utilization, followed by ML-based sensor fusion and control strategies.",

The point cloud of the upper surface will be processed and transformed into a 2D depth map to analyze the in-plane anomalies during the FDM fabrication process. The author used the above data to categorize the surface quality into four categories: under printing, over printing, normal, and empty regions.
